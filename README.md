A custom kekatsu database to allow Twilight menu users to be able to download games directly onto the DS. Notes: any and all of the information listed by kekatsu(like rom region and file size) is completely fake and made up(i couldn't be bothered to add that in the python program) so instead do your own research/look at game title. 

To do this on your own DS, edit the kekatsu databases.txt file and add:

Make sure that the character between the database name is a TAB not a space.

# Note: I will absolutely not be very good at updating this so you can check https://gist.github.com/K9T33NwthTookThis/e1a70d7ce14978373fbe7ea41f6bf3f6 for where i actually upload them to see if i've added any more(atari coming up)

You can also change these out depending on which one's you want.
